In order to support providing Windows Drivers on device in flash, some DisplayLink devices appear at boot to be CDROM devices.

These device's default USB configuration returns class code = mass storage, vendor ID = DisplayLink, and product ID matching the particular DisplayLink device.  Only when the device is switched to configuration #1 does the device function as a display.  That configuration shows no class code, while showing the same vendor and product IDs.

The following devices have this configuration, as of July 2009
