[[!img A basic VNC desktop shown on a DL device] VNC2DL is a VNC client modified by [[Quentin Stafford-Fraser|http://qandr.org/quentin]] to render directly to [[DisplayLink|DisplayLink]] devices.  

With this, you can display a VNC server's output on a [[DisplayLink|DisplayLink]] device. 

There are various reasons you might want to use this: 

* It's relatively easy to start up and kill off multiple VNC desktops at will (on Linux, at least) 
* They can be of any resolution and pixel depth to suit your [[DisplayLink|DisplayLink]] device 
* VNC2DL doesn't have to be running on the same machine as the desktop, or on the same architecture 
* You can have multiple VNC2DL instances connecting to the same desktop 
* The desktop can outlive the VNC2DL instance, so you can disconnect one device and connect another, and bring the same desktop up on it (very different from a graphics card!) 
For download and instructions, see [[Quentin's mailing list posting|http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libdlo/2009-May/000067.html]] or [[VNC2DL's page on GitHub|http://wiki.github.com/quentinsf/vnc2dl]]. 

(VNC2DL was an early and basic user of the libdlo library and would benefit from some of the planned performance improvements to libdlo).
