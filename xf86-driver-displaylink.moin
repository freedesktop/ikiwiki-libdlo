Designed to run on top of the [[displaylink-mod]] linux kernel framebuffer driver.

Latest version available at http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/udlfb-0.2.3_and_xf86-video-displaylink-0.3.tar.gz  Ignore udlfb in this package, and use the latest [[displaylink-mod]] kernel framebuffer driver instead (the same X server works on both old and new framebuffer drivers).

This driver has not yet been picked up by any Linux distributions, but hopefully will soon. Please make any notes here.

See [[XConfiguration]] for more information on xorg.conf files which will properly configure this driver and bring it to life.
